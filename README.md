# Serpentini Backend Challenge

## Run explanations

This exercise can be made with the language you desire (python or javascript).
For each exercise you'll find an entry file in JSON and an expected output format in JSON as well.
Your task is to write a program that process the entry files and outputs a file on the output file format.
As always don't forget to comment your code and make it as clean as possible ! 

```
$ cd level1/
$ python main.py or node main.js
```
